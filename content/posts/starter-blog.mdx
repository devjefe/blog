title: A look at gatsby theme blog starter
---

My first note!

Install Gatsby globally, if you don't have it already.

`yarn global add gatsby`

---

Download the starter with pre installed theme

`gatsby new my-themed-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme`

---

When you are promted, select your package manager. I typically use yarn, but either will do!

`cd my-themed-blog`

---

Start the development server

`yarn start`

---

Now we have a lovely starter blog, with a couple sample posts. As a wonderful bonus, we've also got a dark mode toggler!

In your code editor, take a look at our structure.
