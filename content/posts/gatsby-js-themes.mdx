In July 2019, Gatsby announced the <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-03-announcing-stable-release-gatsby-themes/#reach-skip-nav'> stable release </a> of Gatsby themes an effort lef by Gatsby contractor <a href="https://twitter.com/@chrisbiscardi">Chris Biscardi.</a> Why should you care? Read on...

### 1) Automated dependency updates

Up till now, if we want to quickly scaffold a new Gatsby site, we've had <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/starters/'> starters</a>. Whether you are new to Gatsby or just want to save all the leg work of creating the architecture, starters give you a great leg up.

However, your app can quickly get out of date with stale dependencies and features, and the only real way to update is manually.

Alternatively, a Gatsby theme is resolved through your package manager. Updating core dependencies is a matter of bumping a version in your package.json.

Or as Biscardi puts it, 'Using a Gatsby theme, all of your default configuration (shared functionality, data sourcing, design) is abstracted out of your site, and into an installable package.'

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["gatsby-theme-blog", "gatsby-theme-notes"],
}
```

### 2) MDX

<a href='https://mdxjs.com/'>MDX</a>, also developed by Chris Biscardi, is basically JSX in markdown.

When I set out to build a design system at my day job, MDX changed my life.

I began using MDX to document my components, but now I can't seem to build a site without it.

```jsx
import AwesomeComponent from "./AwesomeComponent"

## Check out my awesome component!

    <AwesomeComponent>{children}</AwesomeComponent>
```

### 3) Component Shadowing

This is where themes get _really_ cool.

Component shadowing 'allows users to replace a file in the src directory that is included in the webpack bundle with their own implementation.'

Don't quite like the out of the box theme Header? Wish you could add/remove/replace a feature? No longer do you have to adopt a 'take it or leave it' approach to a component, just create a file with the same name in the same directory tree and modify it to your heart's content.
